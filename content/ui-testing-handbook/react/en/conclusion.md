Developers spend [21% of their time](https://www.niss.org/sites/default/files/technicalreports/tr81.pdf) fixing bugs. Tests help reduce the amount of work you have to do by catching defects and speeding up debugging. But every new feature introduces more UI and states that need tests. The only way to stay productive is to implement an intuitive testing workflow.

**Start by writing test cases as stories**. You can reuse them in testing tools such as Jest, Chromatic and Axe. Studies suggest that reusing code can shave [42-81% off](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3188437_Evaluating_Software_Reuse_Alternatives_A_Model_and_Its_Application_to_an_Industrial_Case_Study?ev=publicSearchHeader&_sg=g8WraNGZNGPw0R-1-jGpy0XwUDeAr3qb472J6lhisyQ3l24pSmndO6anMdX2L3HdWHifsczPegR9wjA) dev time.

During development, **test while you code** to get a fast feedback loop and catch bugs before hitting production. It's [10x](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20100036670) more expensive to fix bugs in production!

Finally, **use a CI server to run all your checks** across the entire UI to prevent accidental regressions. Research-backed studies from Microsoft suggest that you can see a [20.9% reduction in defects](https://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/Unit_testing_cameraReady.pdf) with automated testing.

When your tests pass, youâ€™ll have confidence that your UI is bug-free.

I hope condensing these learnings into a pragmatic workflow helps you implement a solid testing strategy of your own. Let this be your starting point.
